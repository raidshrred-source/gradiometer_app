      # --- CHANGE 1: Setup Java 17 FIRST ---
      # This is needed for the modern Android SDK Manager
      - name: Setup JDK 17

      # --- CHANGE 2: Accept licenses with Java 17 active ---
      # This step will now use the Java 17 we just set up
      - name: Accept Android Licenses
        run: yes | flutter doctor --android-licenses

      # --- CHANGE 3: Setup Java 11 FOR THE BUILD ---
      # This sets up Java 11 and makes it the default for subsequent steps
      - name: Setup JDK 11 for Flutter Build
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      # --- CHANGE 4: Simplified Build Step ---
      # We no longer need to manually set JAVA_HOME here because the previous
      # 'Setup JDK 11' step already configured the environment correctly.
